If you feel that your class load is too much, drop it before you fail! If you miss the date to have it dropped and cleared off, just remember that a W is better than an F! 

I took too many classes my first semester and ended up failing 2 because I simply didn't understand college (same situation as you: first to go in my family!)

Also, apply for scholarships! There are so many out there, especially if you're going full time. 

Utilize the tutors in Tutoring Central, and all across the different departments. The Math & Computer Science dept has their own tutors. 

Be sure to space your classes apart enough that you have time to get between them. 10 min isn't always enough if you have to sprint across campus! Check out the building acronyms and look on a campus map to be sure you're close enough. 

Utilize your student ID perks! Go to the Wellness Center, it's a great gym. They also offer lots of workout classes. Use it to ride the bus free in Edmond! 

The 7-11 nearby is 24/7 and way cheaper than Starbucks! The Starbucks on campus is closed weekends. 

Stampede Week is at the beginning of the semester and vendors and clubs will be out along the main sidewalk handing out tons of free pencils, notebooks, cookies, chips, sodas, etc. Smile, nod, and collect your way to free school supplies and snacks!

Speaking of supplies, get your books online or through Textbook Brokers across the street on University & Hurd. Way cheaper. 

If you plan on being an art student, shop at Porch School & Art Supply. You'll save so much money.

4. I did hear a few accounts of this happening, both on menâ€™s and womenâ€™s floors
5. Hell it wouldnâ€™t be the weirdest thing to happen in those bathrooms... anywho, there is a lounge on the bottom floor with a small kitchen that people usually wash a few bowls and such in 
6. As far as I know, we havenâ€™t received any new plans for living and dining due to covid other than that we will basically be wearing masks every second we are on campus. But also, I may have just not gotten an email since I am off campus.

I stayed in west for less than a semester, because I had a south facing window on the third floor, and it would reach 85Â° in my room just about everyday, I have no clue who controls the temp, but i complained multiple times and this issue never got fixed or even mitigated. I switched rooms asap.

Showers are great, never had an issue with temp or water pressure.

Never had anything stolen, in fact once I fell asleep before putting my wet clothes in the drier and a lovely person moved them into the drier for me. Don't reccomend doing that, but most people are definitely ""ill treat your laundry the way I want mine treated""

Laundry room has a big sink thats great for dishes, just bring the dishes and some soap and a dish towel.

1. No elevator, I wish you luck with the fridge. If you need help carrying it then I'm sure you can get people to help.

2. Im not sure who controls the temp tbh. I know no one in the hall has control, not even the RA. Mine said that if the temp was bad I needed to file maintenance request.

3. Showers can get as cold or hot as you want. I doubt youll have any complaints about temperature. Pressure is the real issue. If you like high water pressure the you will be sorely disappointed. 

4. I have never had any of my stuff stolen but I have heard of it happening one time when a girl had one t-shirt stolen. Just don't leave your clothes too long and it should be fine. 

5. Not a place that I know of but I have seen plenty of people wash their dishes in the bathroom. Completely acceptable. 

6. Not sure how dorms will be affected, but I imagine dining will continue with their plan from last semester. Normally at Ayers (the main school cafeteria), you serve yourself since it is buffet-style but before spring break the staff started serving for us.

There is a new ESports arena that I didn't get to go to but I've heard amazing things about it. Teachers are hit or miss, I had great teachers and some bad ones. All in all, I loved going to UCO.

188,1c2uxo,"Hi there! I thought I would offer some input as I started as a computer science major as well ~ 85% completion. 

First of all, be sure that you actually want to write code. A lot of incoming freshman equate IT with computer science and they are quite surprised to find they are very different. Your course structure will start with Java in the intro class, moves along to C++ as you progress to higher level classes and mixes java back in when you reach object oriented programming. Visual programming uses visual c++ I believe, and there is usually a COBOL elective (challenging, but also very difficult).

Classes that use c based languages are usually implemented on the schools server, so familiarize yourself with VI and navigating a unix based command line interface.

Computer organization is a class about logic circuits - AND, OR, XOR, NAND etc... Many students are completely thrown off guard by the title of the course.

You will be doing lots of math. I believe it's Calc 1/2 required, 3/4 + differential equations if you want to minor. You will also take physics for science and engineers. 
Discrete structures is an algebra-esque course that trips a lot of people up; it's a doozy.

Instructors -- :::disclaimer::: people change over time and I can only offer my subjective observations when I was enrolled as a compsci student, nearly 3 years ago. Not all of them are the best teachers. I left the program because i did not feel they had my best interest at heart, nor did i believe that they cared to be there. I spent far too many days being read powerpoints verbatim as the instructor sat in their chair. That being said, I harbor no ill will toward any of the professors.


Assuming they are still here- I will list the professor and the class I took with them.

Dr. Turner (comp org 1/2)- Although he may be brash and frighten you, this man has a giant heart for teaching and loves students. Get to know him

Dr. Sung(object oriented programming/ data structures/ethics)- formerly the chair of the department, this guy loves students more than anyone in the department. He loves to have a laugh and will engage you on most topics

Dr. Gourley(visual programming/theories)- very very nice man, likes to read from power points and often laughs at his own jokes that nobody really understands.

Dr. Qian(pronounced Chen) [intro programming] - last I remember he accepted the department chair job and had a lot on his plate. He is a younger man, but a bit hard to relate to. Put the work in and you will do well.

Dr. Park(programming 1/2) - She is a very nice lady with an impressive academic background. She will hold you to a very high standard, but offers tons of help if you just ask for it. Her classes are very difficult.

Dr. Stockwell (discrete structures) - honestly, if you feel confident that you can teach yourself abstract algebraic concepts with very minimal feedback, then go for it. Otherwise, I would highly suggest avoiding stockwell altogether. His class was absolutely a joke, his attendance was sparse (always had a 7/11 or dry cleaner business to go manage) and when he was there, offered very little academic help. He loves to tell you to go read the book when asking questions, his test reviews were nonexistent, and if you ask him to work out a problem on the board, he will do the bare minimum and write QED, because everyone should already understand how to work out the problem. His pass rate was abysmal. Holy tenure batman.

I don't remember too many other professors honestly.

If you want to actually learn statistics, and you will be required to, try to take Dr. Lucas.

For calculus be sure to get Dr. Fulkerson (spelling?).

-Good Luck

189,1c2uxo,"The first question you should ask is what do you ultimately want to do after college? I see you mentioned hardware repair and networking so maybe you want to be in a support role? 

The reason I ask is  a bachelors degree in CompSci will open the door for lots of IT related careers, not just programming. I constantly look at job postings in the IT industry and every single one that pays good money require a Bachelors in CompSci or Information Systems Management or similar. This applies to system admins, network admins, programmers, database admins, etc. 

If the CompSci degree plan sounds too intensive, there is also an Applied Computer bScience degree. Less math and programming, but still an excellent degree. I would post a link, but I am on my phone.

Final tip, if you do come to UCO, apply for a student worker job at the IT Service Desk. It will give you lots of experience in troubleshooting, customer service, and help you meet all the IT people.

I think that it isn't right that the student government made this change.  Not every student on campus participates in student organizations/clubs and can be represented by a Student Senator or Student House Rep.  It should have been a vote issued on UConnect, as it affects everyone who is on campus, not just the students.

The campus-wide WiFi blows. Everywhere. It tests just under the numbers I get in my room, but for some reason is far slower. Thankfully, the ethernet in my room makes up for it. 

*Make sure to bring a Cat-5 cable on Day 1! Otherwise you might not be able to use the WiFi.*

Also, if you are using a Windows based computer on the WiFi network, you have to keep a browser window open to a ""security tunnel login"" at all times. It sucks a lot and thankfully I have a Mac. (If you have a Mac, Linux, or an iOS device you just need to register the MAC Address for the WiFi card with IT)

As far as rules go, there is no torrenting or other peer-to-peer file-sharing on the network. I've never heard of anybody getting busted for it, and when I did a story for The Vista on the state of the network a year ago, they said that they had no system in place to detect ""abuse"" of the network.

For the record I do not torrent on the network, legal or otherwise, out of respect for the rules.

In the two years I've been here, the network has been down only a few times, each for less than 30 minutes. The longest one was a planned outage that everyone was warned about and lasted just over 35 minutes for some people, others were completely unaffected.

Friends are so valuable and helpful. Make friends with other students in your class. Spend time in the Math lab. Get to know the people there. If you need help with something, talk to your professor, your friends, or the tutors in the math lab. 

Don't get behind on lectures. Make sure you understand the concepts from the previous lecture before the next lecture. Review your notes before class. Start assignments way ahead before they're due.

*Pros:*

No commute time and no hassle finding parking in the morning  
Do not have to worry about monthly bills  
*Depending on housing unit - do not have to worry about meals  
There is an RA and staff to communicate issues to  
On campus at night when SAB holds events


*Cons:*

Housing cost is over-priced for what you get  
*Depending on unit, forced to purchase a meal plan  
Under constant supervision - i.e, no partying  
*Depending on unit, lack of personal privacy  
If you leave campus, good luck finding good parking
&nbsp;

**Off-Campus**

*Pros:*

Cost is significantly less than living on campus  
Can park close(r) to where you reside  
Freedom to do as you please (within reason) w/o constant supervision  
Not forced to purchase a meal plan  
Can have more privacy depending on where you reside


*Cons:*

Have to commute to campus and locate parking  
Need to manage your finances to pay for monthly bills/food  
If issues arise between roommates, no staff to mediate the issue with  
Lease agreements don't always align with scholastic calendar  
Will not be on campus for night-time events, unless you make an active attempt do be on campus then

&nbsp;

Those are just some pros and cons for each I've come up with. I've done both. If you are just out of HS and want to get the ""experience"" of college, living on campus could be what is best for you. Just know that ""experience"" costs money. UCO is mostly a commuter school, so the events will usually only draw the small amount of students who reside on campus, as opposed the majority of students. 

Personally for me, I prefer living off campus. I've had terrible experiences with UCO Housing & Dining and my roommates. I also personally think UCO charges outlandish prices for what they offer, when you compare it to what can be found outside of campus. Each person is different, so what I see as an issue, may not be seen the same way by yourself. I would suggest taking a tour if you have not done so already. Ask questions to get a sense of what you can expect. I would also suggest looking at off-campus housing as well and doing the same thing, if it is available for you to do.

Also I wouldnâ€™t make a decision on a specific subsection of poly-Sci until youâ€™ve had the time to be in college and feel your way into it.

331,3p4mdb,"From the places I've stayed:

Kickingbird Apts: Old buildings, I think its the cheapest place save for Bryant Place. When I lived there I had no issues at all, but that was several years ago. 7/10

Bryant Place: The cheapest place to live by yourself. One monthly bill to pay, split electric four ways. If you have a friend wanting to move in with you, then this is probably the worst place, costwise. I never had any maintenance issues, and when I did it they *seemed* to be fixed quickly. However, I remember the neighbors being the worst I've ever had. Friday and Saturday nights plan on having huge parties around your place. Lots of noise. Rooms are rather small, and you can't pick your roommates so that's a tossup. A lot of people I've known have told utter horror stories about this place and treat it like the plague, but my experience was probably 5/10

The Cottages: For the size they are, they're really cheap as well. Its less than a 20 minute walk from here to Howell Hall, but its also a long way from anything else, if you're walking. You also get a garage, but you need to provide your own Washer/Dryer and the Hookups for that are in the garage. No direct access to the garage (you have to go outside to get in). The sq. footage is pretty big. If you take a tour, remember the ""sun room"" is a non-airconditioned quasi-room. I kept my PC in there, but that room used to be about 5-10 degrees hotter than the rest of the house. The buildings are rather old, and maintenance is very slow. My room flooded twice and I spent the last couple months living in the living room. They did say a lot of units flooded. The complex is run independently, which is nice because you can have direct contact with the landlord, but they seem to have many problems with contracted maintenance. 4/10

Oxford Oaks: I live here now, this place is fine, I've only had a couple issues with it being a corporate-run complex. The people in the office can be dicks. I've had a bug problem for awhile, and it took them a month for them to send exterminators. A benefit of living here is being within 5 mins walking distance of basically anywhere you want to eat in the area, JJs, China House, Nhinja, Taco Bell, Cicis, Qdoba etc. BUT you're a 30 minute walk from school. 7/10

Places my friends have stayed:

Kennedy Place/University Village: These felt like the most run-down apts in Edmond (I'm sure there are worse). Couple friends of mine are moving out because they can't get rid of the bed bugs. The location of these also feel so tucked away and hidden that they just feel unsafe, idk how else to put it. The size of the apartment was good and the price was insanely low, however.

Summit Apartments: I've only been in these and they felt nice. No idea about price or anything else. They're also very far away from anything if you don't have a car.

Avana: I've had a few friends stay there and haven't heard complaints. Its a huge corporate-complex like Oxford Oaks though.

Dillon Park: These are similar to Bryant Place. You get 3 roommates, but you share a bathroom with one. (4 bed/2 bath). Price is about the same as Bryant Place. Last I knew they were also pet friendly (deposit most likely). They're also right next to school.


When you're looking for places, remember most of the reviews you'll read online are from people who had a bad experience, and it takes ONE bad experience to totally ruin your opinion of everything. I also find it hard to trust the good reviews often because nobody will ever say ""OMG LIVING HERE WAS AMAZING."" You either hate the apartment you live in, or you feel ""meh"" about it. No news is good news imo. If you ask a few friends and they all shrug their shoulders about where they live, its probably a good sign.",cw64vnp,1445351489.0,2015-10-20 09:31:29

Do you, personally, feel that there should be designated housing spots in the libraryâ€™s parking lot? Why do you feel this way?
No, because I don't live on campus. If you asked me this back when I used to live on campus I would've probably said yes, but there is residential parking right next to the library already, although, that parking is pretty insufficient. ",c2z0s4f,1321062609.0,2011-11-11 19:50:09

As a commuter, I find this very frustrating. I'm not sure how far the dorms are from the library, but I feel that if you live on campus, its not going to kill you to just walk to the library. So, no. I think parking should be a free-for-all because I pay just as much to use the library's facilities as someone who lives on campus.
