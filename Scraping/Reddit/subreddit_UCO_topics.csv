So...Peeps on campus have been having issues with accessing imgur.com. I have found a workaround for the issue. This issue appears to be linked to the Time to live set by imgur's DNS...this isn't something we can resolve from our end.

Scenario:
You're browsing reddit, and you see something in r/funny that you just have to click on. OH DAMNIT! IMGUR appears down! Fear not, here is the workaround.

__________________________________________
Keep the website up in your browser.

open up a command prompt. Start > Run > cmd < hit enter >
type nslookup < hit enter >
type imgur.com < hit enter >

You should receive some text back saying the following: 

Server: jupiter.uco.local Address: 172.16.16.10
*** jupiter.uco.local can't find imgur.com: Server failed

type imgur.com (again) < hit enter >

Should receive the following text:

Your friendly IT team has decided that they have nothing better to do this weekend and are going to wreak havoc on the network! Okay, not really. Well, maybe a little, but don't tell anyone! ;) So, while you guys are sleeping off the previous nights' extravaganza, your fellow IT folks will be doing what we do best...IT stuff.

As usual, we are going to be performing maintenance this Sunday from 5 a.m to 10 a.m.  Here are some of the highlights of this weekends maintenance:

* The Central Authentication Service server will be brought down to clean up some log files that have been growing for some time.  This should be unavailable for approx. 5 to 10 mins.  Should this change or we encounter some issues, I will post an update immediately to r/UCO. 

* The D2L URL train.uco.edu is being changed to learn.uco.edu.  As a proactive measure, we have already configured the CAS to accept this URL.  As soon as the DNS change is made and the CAS is back up, you guys can start using the new learn.uco.edu URL. (Happy Dance!)

* UConnect Portal will be doing a database re-index this weekend. During this period, UConnect may be unavailable.

* Our Database admins will be conducting some maintenance on Banner in order to make password complexity fall in line with University policy.  They will also be making a small change to Banner that will hopefully keep the channels in UConnect from crapping out so often.

* UCO Streaming services will be unavailable while we apply some patches to this server. 

We hope everyone has a good weekend and for those of you old enough, try not to have too much fun at the Choctaw Oktoberfest!

As I lived on campus my entire first year and had little idea what to expect going in, I thought I would share with any incoming freshman on this subreddit my experiences and offer a little advice. (I'm also incredibly bored at work, so I have the free time to do this.)

There are four options for student housing:

Murdaugh/West Hall

Central Plaza (CP)

The Commons

The Suites

**Murdaugh/West Hall**
This is the basic ""college"" dorm. Murdaugh is a men's dorm and West Hall is a women's dorm. These dorms have communal bathrooms and there are two people to a room. I did not live here, so I do not have a lot of insight as to the details, but I chose not to live here because I did not want communal restrooms. Both are located somewhat centrally on campus, so you would not have a long walk to class. This is also the cheapest option.

**Central Plaza (CP)**
CP is a dorm that used to be a hotel. It is across the street from UCO and will give you the longest walk to classes. There is a deli on the first floor of CP that takes flex dollars and meal trade options. The beds are bigger here than the suites as well. (I think they're full size)

**The Commons**
The Commons are apartment-style housing. There are two-bedroom and four-bedroom Commons. Both options have two bathrooms, as well as a kitchen and a living room. If you live in the Commons, you are not required to have a meal plan, which makes it significantly less expensive. Personally,  I wish I had chosen to live here.

**The Suites**
The suites are just as they sound, suite-style dorms. There are doubles and quads, and the beds are extra-long twins. I lived in a quad-suite my freshman year, and while I enjoyed it, I would never do it again. My roommate and I never met our suitemates, just shared a bathroom with them. The Broncho Sports Grill, the best place to eat on campus outside of the Nigh food court, is located on the first floor of the Suites, which is a plus.


For meal plans, I would suggest getting the 7 meals per week with the high amount of flex dollars. There are a few things in the Grill that you cannot use a meal-trade for, so I enjoyed the high amount of flex, and if you do not have any meals left that week, you can buy a meal with flex dollars.

If anyone has any questions or suggestions to add, just let me know, and thanks for reading.",2012-06-14 03:47:29

So, you've possibly heard that all student e-mail will be switching to G-mail accounts. I'm a beta tester and work at tech support so I thought I'd give some insight.

What this means is:

- Still keeping your @uco.edu address
- More space for storage
- Your old e-mails shown on UCOnnect will ALL be transferred (mine did)
- More customization for your inbox
- A deleted folder!!!! 
- No having to go to UCOnnect to access e-mail

**But most importantly**
- E-mail sent straight to your phone! You'll set it up through Exchange and it's so much easier.

In any case, it's mostly a thousand times better than the old e-mail. 

But here's a link to the UCO page about it!

I also, unfortunately, have to pay bills which means I have to work. 
My parent's already pay for all my tuition so I don't feel like asking them to help me pay for living expenses. And living on campus would be more expensive than my current living arrangements. 

I was wondering if anybody had any suggestions on what to do. I am really just feeling overwhelmed, and I have quite a bit to go and at the rate I'm going I'll be a seventh year senior by the time I graduate. I currently work 22 hours a week, have a 10 hour course load, commute, and try to fit in 5-7 hours a week at a gym.

Also, with my parents' income I have no financial need for scholarships, so should I even bother applying for scholarships?

As normal, our maintenance window is going to run from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m.  Here's some of the highlights of what we will be doing this weekend:

* Central Authentication Services will be down briefly during the maintenance window this weekend.  This means that for a brief period of time you will not be able to access your UCO GMail, D2L (Desire2Learn) and Qualtrics (University Survey System).

* The UCO Main website will be down briefly to resolve some slight performance issues.

* EMS Master Calendar will be unavailable for a brief period of time while we upgrade to the newest version (v4.0).  

* the CPDE Website (Distance Learning and Eduction) will be re-branded as CeCE (Center for eLearning and Continuing Education).  During the re-branding, the website may be briefly unavailable.

* UConnect Portal will be doing a database re-index this weekend.  During this period, UConnect may be unavailable. 

* Network team will be replacing some network switches in the NUC as well as replacing the UPS for the University Telephone System.

* UCOBlogs may be down briefly while we move that server to a new host within our virtual environment.

How long did you have to wait to find out about financial aid? And did you have to constantly check in with one stop to find out your status? Did you feel like you had to move the process along yourself vs someone guiding you through the process?
Some background: my wife is going back to school to get her 2nd degree, at UCO. From day one, she's been on top of getting her financial aid stuff done. She did the FAFSA but now she keeps running into problems. There's been a whole boat load of issues that have been fixed by a ton of calls to one stop but still the people she talks to keeps saying they need to do one more thing before it's fixed... It's getting really frustrating because she has been calling them and they say they are fixing it and never do. 

I'm just wondering if this is how incompetent this school is or is it because of her unique situation that they don't really know how to handle?

149,Political Science Major,2,dica45,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCO/comments/dica45/political_science_major/,4,1571193624.0,"Hello r/UCO,

As I am a senior in high school, a prospective political science major of the sort, I was honestly wondering if UCO is a good university to go to for the major of Political Science. I know I will study at a university in state, so i'm in questioning of what university I should attend for this specific major. Not to say of any school is better, that's not why I'm here, but I have seen that OU has a pretty big Poli Sci organization compared to every other university in Oklahoma; plus OU is a research university, so If needed I could peruse a doctorate degree there. 

Another thought. I see that at UCO under the branch of Poli Sci I could major in something more specific in the field such as:

1. Political Science - Public Administration
2. Political Science - International Relations

Could majoring in something above be better for my resume, or help me in any instance?  

Any information/help or redirecting would be really helpful! Thanks for reading.

If there is a better sub-reddit I should post this in please redirect me to as such.",2019-10-15 21:40:24
